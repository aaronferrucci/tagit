Each podcast file needs three tags:
TCON: Podcast
TALB: podcast name, e.g. "Pod Save America"
TIT2: episode title, e.g. "Trump's Grand Opening"

id3v2 --TCON Podcast *.mp3

"Planet Money" acts weird: each episode appears in its own "Planet Money"
folder on the watch. I don't see any tag reason why this should be so.
silly experiment: remove the '#' character from the episode title: 

01_398_Unsheltered_in_Place_pt01.mp3
tags:
TIT2: 398- Unsheltered in Place pt01
TPE1: Roman Mars
Q: with no TCON=Podcast, why does it end up under podcasts?
Q: did the watch fall back on TPE1 for the podcast name (no TALB)?
